# See-SURF

A Python based scanner to find potential SSRF parameters in a web application. See-SURF helps you detect potential SSRF parameters and validates the finding it by making a DNS/HTTP request back to your server. It can be added to your arsenal of recon while doing bug hunting/web security testing.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- `Python3`

## How to use?
 Burp Sitemap (<b>-b switch</b>) & Connect back to your server (<b> -p switch </b>) <br/><br/>
 <b>Complete Command would look like this - </b> <br/>
 <b>`python3 see-surf.py -H https://www.google.com -c cookie_name1=value1 cookie_name2=value2 -b burp_file.xml -p http://72.72.72.72:8000` </b><br/>
` -H - Host name/Ip address`<br/>
` -c - Cookies seperated by space (Some websites use multiple cookies for session tracking`<br/>
` -b (Optional but recommended) - Spider the request using burp, export the file and give it to see-surf as input (check detailed features on how to do it)`<br/>
` -p (Optional but recommended) - Your own web server/burp collaborator, the script will try to connect back for validation of SSRF params`<br/><br/>

## Features
1) Takes burp's sitemap as input and parses and parses the file with a strong regex matches any GET/POST URL parameters containing potentially vulnerable SSRF keywords like URL/website etc. Also,
checks the parameter values for any URL or IP address passed.
Examples
GET request -<br/>
google.com/url=https://yahoo.com <br/>
google.com/q=https://yahoo.com <br/>
FORMS -<br/> `<input type="text" name="url" value="https://google.com" placeholder="https://msn.com">`
<br/><br/>
2) Multi-threaded In-built crawler to run and gather as much data as possible to parse and identify potentially vulnerable SSRF parameters.
<br/><br/>
3) Supply cookies for an authenticated scanning.
<br/><br/>
4) By default, normal mode is On, with a verbose switch you would see the same vulnerable param in different endpoints. The same parameter may not be sanitized at all places. But verbose mode generates a lot of noise.
Example:<br/>
https://google.com/path/1/urlToConnect=https://yahoo.com <br/>
https://google.com/differentpath/urlToConnect=https://yahoo.com
<br/><br/>
5) Exploitation - Makes an external request to burp collaborator or any other http server with the vulnerable parameter to confirm the possibility of SSRF. 
<br/><br/>

## Detailed Features with Flags
[-] This would run with default threads=10, no cookies/session and NO verbose mode <br/>
`python3 see-surf.py -H https://www.google.com`

[-] Space separate Cookies can be supplied for an authenticated session crawling <br/>
`python3 see-surf.py -H https://www.google.com -c cookie_name1=value1 cookie_name2=value2`


[-] Supplying no. of threads and verbose mode (Verbose Mode Is Not Recommended If You Don't Want To Spend Longer Time But The 
Possibility Of Bug Finding Increases)<br/>
`python3 see-surf.py -H https://www.google.com -c cookie_name1=value1 cookie_name2=value2 -t 20 -v`

By Default, normal mode is On, with verbose switch you would see the same potential vulnerable param in different endpoints. 
(Same parameter may not be sanitized at all places. But verbose mode generates a lot of noise.)
<br/>Example: <br/>
https://google.com/abc/1/urlToConnect=https://yahoo.com <br/>
https://google.com/123/urlToConnect=https://yahoo.com

### Version-2 Features

[-] <b>-b switch</b> Provide burp sitemap files for a better discovery of potential SSRF parameters. The script would first parse the burp file and try to identify potential params and then run the built in crawler on it <br/><br/>
Browser the target with your burpsuite running at the background, make some GET/POST requests, the more the better. Then go to target, right click-> "Save selected Items" and save it. Provide to the script as follows. <br/>
`python3 see-surf.py -H https://www.google.com -c cookie_name1=value1 cookie_name2=value2 -b burp_file.xml`

[-] <b>-p switch</b> Fire up burpsuite collaborator and pass the host with -p parameter Or start a simple python http server and wait for the 
vulnerable param to execute your request. <b>(Highly Recommended)</b><br/>
(This basically helps in exploiting GET requests, for POST you would need to try to exploit it manually)<br/>
Payload will get executed with the param at the end of the string so its easy to identify which one is vulnerable.
For example: http://72.72.72.72:8000/vulnerableparam <br/>

`python3 see-surf.py -H https://www.google.com -c cookie_name1=value1 cookie_name2=value2 -p http://72.72.72.72:8000`
