# See-SURF


## Project title
Python based scanner to find potential SSRF parameters in a web application.

## Motivation
SSRF being one of the critical vulnerabilities out there, i see there was not a tool which would scan the potential
vulnerale parameters. See-SURF automates the process of finding SSRF bugs while doing bug hunting/web application testing.

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. - 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco)
[![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/akashnimare/foco?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/akashnimare/foco/branch/master)

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features
1) Matches any GET URL Parameters containing web/url for example google.com/url=https://yahoo.com also 
checks the parameter values for any URL or IP address passed. example google.com/q=https://yahoo.com

2) Matches any POST request INPUT params with "Name" attribute containing containing web/url
And also matches Values and Placeholder attribute containing a URL pattern
for example: <input type="text" name="url" value="https://google.com"

3) Multiple conditions to cut down false positives. 

4) By Default normal mode is On, with verbose switch you would see the same vulnerable param in different endpoints
For example: 


## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
